	people and governments. Vaccines are an available solution to
	this pandemic. Recipients of the vaccines are of different ages,
	gender, and religion. Muslims follow specific Islamic guidelines
	that prohibit them from taking a vaccine with certain
	ingredients. This study aims at analyzing Facebook and Twitter
	data to understand the discourse related to halal vaccines using
	aspect-based sentiment analysis and text emotion analysis. We
	searched for the term ``halal vaccine'' and limited the timeline
	to the period between 1 January 2020, and 30 April 2021, and
	collected 6037 tweets and 3918 Facebook posts. We performed data
	preprocessing on tweets and Facebook posts and built the Latent
	Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to identify topics. Calculating
	the sentiment analysis for each topic was the next step.
	Finally, this study further investigates emotions in the data
	using the National Research Council of Canada Emotion Lexicon.
	Our analysis identified four topics in each of the Twitter
	dataset and Facebook dataset. Two topics of ``COVID-19 vaccine''
	and ``halal vaccine'' are shared between the two datasets. The
	other two topics in tweets are ``halal certificate'' and ``must
	halal'', while ``sinovac vaccine'' and ``ulema council'' are two
	other topics in the Facebook dataset. The sentiment analysis
	shows that the sentiment toward halal vaccine is mostly neutral
	in Twitter data, whereas it is positive in Facebook data. The
	emotion analysis indicates that trust is the most present
	emotion among the top three emotions in both datasets, followed
	by anticipation and fear.",

	dealing with Big Data. The hierarchical method with the BIRCH

	BIRCH algorithm is a matching grouping algorithm for very large

	in this paper proposes a solution to this deficiency by
	modifying the Threshold value to dynamic so that it can produce
	good cluster quality and be validated using silhouette

	science. Obtaining high spatial resolution data can be crucial
	in some studies. Sentinel-2 provides data of 10, 20 and 60 m,
	and it is a promising program for Earth observation studies.
	Although Sentinel-2 provides a high range of multispectral
	bands, the lack of panchromatic band disables the production of
	a set of fine-resolution (10 m) bands. However, few methods have
	been developed for increasing the spatial resolution of the 20 m
	bands up to 10 m. In this study, three different methods of
	producing panchromatic bands have been compared. The first
	method uses the closest higher spatial resolution band to the
	lowest spatial resolution band as a panchromatic band, the
	second method uses one single band as the panchromatic band
	produced as an average value out of all fine resolution bands,
	while the third method uses linear correlation for the selection
	of the panchromatic band. The 60 m bands have not been taken
	into consideration in this study. In order to compare these
	methods, three image fusion techniques from different fusion
	subsections (Component substitution---Intensity Hue Saturation
	IHS; Numerical method---High Pass Filter HPF; Hybrid

	abstract  = "Networks play important roles in modern life, and cyber security
	has become a vital research area. An intrusion detection system
	(IDS) which is an important cyber security technique, monitors
	the state of software and hardware running in the network.
	Despite decades of development, existing IDSs still face
	challenges in improving the detection accuracy, reducing the
	false alarm rate and detecting unknown attacks. To solve the
	above problems, many researchers have focused on developing IDSs
	that capitalize on machine learning methods. Machine learning
	methods can automatically discover the essential differences
	between normal data and abnormal data with high accuracy. In
	addition, machine learning methods have strong generalizability,
	so they are also able to detect unknown attacks. Deep learning
	is a branch of machine learning, whose performance is remarkable
	and has become a research hotspot. This survey proposes a
	taxonomy of IDS that takes data objects as the main dimension to
	classify and summarize machine learning-based and deep
	learning-based IDS literature. We believe that this type of
	taxonomy framework is fit for cyber security researchers. The
	survey first clarifies the concept and taxonomy of IDSs. Then,
	the machine learning algorithms frequently used in IDSs,
	metrics, and benchmark datasets are introduced. Next, combined
	with the representative literature, we take the proposed
	taxonomic system as a baseline and explain how to solve key IDS
	issues with machine learning and deep learning techniques.

	productivity, fertilizer needed, weed control costs in a circle

	objective of this study is to build a robust and user-friendly
	method that will allow oil palm managers to count oil palm trees

	this study have different ages and densities. QuickBird imagery
	was applied with the six pansharpening methods and was compared
	with panchromatic QuickBird imagery. The black and white imagery
	from a false colour composite of pansharpening imagery was
	processed in three ways: (1) oil palm tree detection, (2)
	delineation of the oil palm area using the red band, and (3)
	counting oil palm trees and accuracy assessment. For oil palm
	detection, we used several filters that contained a Sobel edge
	detector; texture analysis co-occurrence; and dilate, erode,
	high-pass, and opening filters. The results of this study

	abstract  = "For obtaining a spatial map of the distribution of nitrogen
	nutrients from oil palm plantations, a quite complex Leaf
	Sampling Unit (LSU) is required. In addition, sample analysis in
	the laboratory is time consuming and quite expensive, especially
	for large plantation areas. Monitoring the nutrition of oil palm
	plants can be achieved using remote-sensing technology. The main
	obstacles of using passive sensors in multispectral imagery are
	cloud cover and shadow noise. This research used C-SAR Sentinel
	equipped with active sensors that can overcome cloud barriers. A
	model to estimate leaf nitrogen nutrient status was constructed
	using random forest regression (RFR) based on multiple
	polarization (VV-VH) and local incidence angle (LIA) data on
	Sentinel-1A imagery. A sample of 1116 LSU data from different
	islands (i.e., Sumatra, Java, and Kalimantan) was used to
	develop the proposed estimation model. The performance
	evaluation of the model obtained the averaged MAPE, correctness,
	and MSE of 9.68\%, 90.32\% and 11.03\%, respectively. Spatial
	maps of the distribution of nitrogen values in certain oil palm
	areas can be produced and visualized on the web so that they can
	be accessed easily and quickly for various purposes of oil palm
	management such as fertilization planning, recommendations, and
